# Music Grid Sequencer 🎶
A music sequencer built with AI support.  
Grid-based pattern triggering for multiple instruments (Kick, Snare, Bass, etc.)

## How It Works
- 64x64 Grid → Time x Notes
- Colored pixels = instrument triggers
- Loop = 4 seconds ⏱️
- AI-assisted using Cursor, DeepSeek, and Kimi

## Tech Stack
- Python and its libraries 
- AI-assisted code by Cursor

> Built with love, curiosity, and pure grind
